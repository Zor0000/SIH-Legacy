## 1. Introduction
Indian Coal Mine Carbon Footprint Web Application is a comprehensive solution designed to help Indian coal mines quantify their carbon footprint and explore pathways to carbon neutrality. The application aims to assist coal mine operators in tracking, reducing, and offsetting their carbon emissions through data-driven strategies and actionable insights.

## 2. Problem Statement
India's coal mining industry is a significant contributor to carbon emissions, which poses challenges to the country’s climate change commitments. To achieve carbon neutrality, coal mines must adopt strategies to reduce their emissions and offset remaining emissions through methods like afforestation. The lack of a dedicated tool to quantify carbon emissions and explore reduction pathways creates a gap in achieving these sustainability goals.
