## 1. Introduction
The Indian Coal Mine Carbon Footprint Web Application is a comprehensive solution designed to help Indian coal mines quantify their carbon footprint and explore pathways to carbon neutrality. This application assists coal mine operators in tracking, reducing, and offsetting their carbon emissions through data-driven strategies and actionable insights.

## 2. Problem Statement
India's coal mining industry significantly contributes to carbon emissions, posing challenges to the country’s climate change commitments. To achieve carbon neutrality, coal mines must adopt strategies to reduce emissions and offset the remainder through methods like afforestation. The absence of a dedicated tool to quantify carbon emissions and explore reduction pathways creates a gap in achieving these sustainability goals.

## 3. Project Objectives
- **Quantify Carbon Emissions:** Provide detailed calculations of carbon emissions based on various mining activities.
- **Assess Carbon Sinks:** Evaluate existing carbon sinks, such as forests, to understand their offset potential.
- **Suggest Carbon Neutrality Pathways:** Offer strategies for reducing emissions through clean technologies, afforestation, and renewable energy sources.
- **Visualize Data:** Present results through interactive charts and graphs for better understanding and decision-making.

## 4. Solution Overview
This web application enables coal mines to input data regarding their mining activities, calculates the associated carbon emissions, and evaluates potential pathways to carbon neutrality. It provides clear and actionable reports on how to achieve sustainability goals, supported by data visualization tools.

## 5. Core Features
- **Activity-wise Carbon Emission Calculation:** Users can input data related to excavation, transportation, and equipment usage to calculate emissions.
